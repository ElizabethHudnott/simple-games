All numbers are unsigned and little endian.

Flags (1 byte: swap x&y, compressed)
Tile width (1 byte, 0..255)
Tile height (1 byte, 0.255)
Map width (2 bytes, 1..65536)
Maximum number of high resolution tiles per row (2 bytes, 0..65535)

If the swap x&y flag is NOT set:
	Tile numbers for the 1st row, in left to right order (1 byte each)
	High resolution tile space for the the 1st row
	Tile numbers for the 2nd row, in left to right order (1 byte each)
	High resolution tile space for the the 2nd row
	...

If the swap x&y flag IS set:
	Tile numbers for the 1st column, in top to bottom order (1 byte each)
	High resolution tile space for the the 1st column
	Tile numbers for the 2nd column, in top to bottom order (1 byte each)
	High resolution tile space for the the 2nd column
	...

Tile numbers are recorded using one byte each:
	0..254	Use the tile associated with that number.
	255		Glue four different tiles together (each 1/4 of the regular tile size) using information from the high resolution tile space.

The high resolution tile space is a list of entries in following format. The list is in ascending order by column or row number.
	The column number of the high resolution tile (or row number if the swap x&y flag is set, 2 bytes, 1..65535)
		OR 65536 if the previous entry was the last entry in list.
	Tile number for the top-left quarter of the tile (1 byte, 0..255)
	Tile number for the top-right quarter of the tile (1 byte, 0..255)
	Tile number for the bottom-left quarter of the tile (1 byte, 0..255)
	Tile number for the bottom-right quarter of the tile (1 byte, 0..255)
(6 bytes per entry in total)

The high resolution tile space must always be 6 * the maximum number of high resolution tiles per row, although once a column number of 65536 appears then the rest of the bytes are ignored.

Specifications:
	* Up to 65536 tiles per row.
	* Up to 256 different tile images.

Limitations:
	* Tile number 255 can only be used as part of a high resolution tile.
	* Column 65536 cannot contain high resolution tiles.
