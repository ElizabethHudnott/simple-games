					Games for Novice Programmers to Deconstruct

				This site contains classic games and game making tutorials for people who are just beginning learning programming. It doesn't use any point and click tools specifically designed for making video games (such as Unity or Clickteam products). You can achieve a lot with those tools without knowing very much about programming. Call me old school but I consider that to be cheating. Instead, I assume your objectives include a strong desire to learn about the programming techniques involved and how the code works and provides instructions for the machine to carry out. We'll start off by only using some very basic logic and then we'll build on that by gradually beginning to use more of the browser's APIs and some more sophisticated programming techniques. None of the games here are very impressive by modern standards, they're just provided to assist with developing technical skills.
